# Predicting-Taxi-Fares-with-Random-Forests
In this project, we get to work with the data from a large number of taxi journeys in New York from 2013. We will use regression trees and random forests to predict the value of fares and tips, based on location, date and time. While not required, it can help to have some extended experience with the packages dplyr, ggplot2 and randomForests.
